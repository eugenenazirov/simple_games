# simple_games

Welcome to Simple Games repo, guys!
There are simple games that I made using Python, when I study the EngineerSpock course on Udemy.

I started coding on March 2022 and this is my first Python code projects.
I want to save this files like a memoire, and look out for it code after yeeaars :)

Keep calm and learn coding!
With love @eugenenazirov
